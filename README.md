DigitSum is supposed to become a Java library concentrating on tasks around calculating the sums of digits for numbers.
I wasn't able to find a decent library for this purpose, so I either could have decided to upgrade my Google skills or to try out the IntelliJ IDEA, GitHub, Travis CI pipeline.
 I opted for the latter.

 Perhaps some of you will find this useful one day.
